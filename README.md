# word2vec_visualization

This document presents an analysis of the 50-dimension words embedding computed with GloVe (Global Vectors for word representation) and available [here](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/). 

In the first part, we look how to extract the the nearest neighbors of certain words, and observe their distributions with a parallel coordinates plot.

In the second part, we try to observe the clusters in 2 dimensions with PCA.
